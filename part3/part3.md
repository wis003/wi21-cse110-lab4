Part 1:
 - See breakpoints.png for the breakpoints screenshot.
 - See watch_expressions.png for the screenshot of watched variables.
 - What was the bug? The bug was that num1 and num2 were strings, so in calculateSum, the + operator was concatenating the two strings and result was a string.
 - See fix.png for the fixed result. The fix was to convert num1 and num2 into numbers with the Numbers() function.
